Of course! That sounds like an awesome project ðŸ”¥  
Here are some **ideas** you can include for a **healthcare/hospital mobile app**:

---

**1. User Features:**  
- **Profile Management** (patients and doctors)  
- **Appointment Booking** (select doctor, date, time)  
- **Medical History** (store prescriptions, past visits, diagnoses)  
- **Medication Reminders** (notify user when itâ€™s time to take medicine)  
- **Symptom Checker** (basic questions that guide user on next steps)  
- **Consult a Doctor (Chat/Video)** (virtual consultation feature)  
- **Health Records Upload** (upload x-rays, blood tests, reports)  
- **Payment Gateway** (pay for appointments, medications)

---

**2. Doctor Features:**  
- **Doctor Profile** (specialization, experience, availability)  
- **Manage Appointments** (accept, reschedule, cancel)  
- **Patient Medical Records Access** (view patientâ€™s history before consultation)  
- **Prescription Management** (send digital prescriptions to user)  
- **Consultation via Video/Chat** (do video calls or chat consultations)

**3. Medication & Pharmacy:**  
- **E-Prescriptions** (patients get prescriptions digitally)

**5. Admin Panel (Optional if youâ€™re building backend too):**

Would you also like me to quickly sketch a **basic screen flow** you can use too? ðŸš€  
(like Home Screen â†’ Book Doctor â†’ Payment, etc.)  
Itâ€™ll help you even more if youâ€™re planning out your screens! ðŸŽ¨
